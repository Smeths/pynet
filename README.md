# NeuralNet
Python Neural Network Class

# todo:

1, Find out what a convulution net is
2, Check neuralnet against neuralnetGen for handwriting problem, currently small difference in accuracy
3, Try to find other problems for which neural works may be useful and some guide lines on how to apply them, try: http://makeyourownneuralnetwork.blogspot.co.uk/ first.
