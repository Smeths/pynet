# Todo:

1. Find out what a convulution net is
2. Look into random seeds for generating initial weights/storing weights in binary files
3. Check neuralnet against neuralnetGen for handwriting problem, currently small difference in accuracy
4. See if you can reproduce results and per blog correspondences
5. Explore complex number node ideas
6. Look into using a deeper net to do face recognition problems
 
# Outline:

This project is based on ideas discussed at [Make Your Own Neural Net Blog](http://makeyourownneuralnetwork.blogspot.co.uk)

1. neuralNetwork.py, train.py and test.py net, training and testing for a single hidden layer net
2. neuralNetwork2.py, train2.py and test2.py net, training and testing for a double hidden layer net
3. neuralNetworkGen.py, trainGen.py and testGen.py net, training and testing for a net with multiple hidden layers

As the data for the traing and test the net is very large it has not been uploaded to github, it can be downloaded from the following links.
